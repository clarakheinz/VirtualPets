# VirtualPets

## A fun console app game where you can make a virtual pet and interact with it.

### Code Louisville C# Project

As a part of Code Louisville curriculum, we are required to complete a project from complete scratch. I have chosen a very light version of a childhood game I loved. In this game, you can create a virtual pet, name it, feed it, and play with it. While it is not nearly as exciting as a real life pet, it is a much easier pet to care for!

Required baseline features in this project:
- Classes
- 3 Methods created and called within the application

Features included in this project:
- Master loop:
    - All menu classes in the application feature a Do..While loop that allows for repeated user input and interaction
- Inheritance:
    - Dog and Cat inherit from VirtualPet. Cat does not vary from the base class, however, Dog has an added interaction method Walk.
- Calculate data:
    - Inside of VirtualPet is a Calc_Age function which takes in today's date and creates a calculated age in day for the pet.
- Logging:
    - *coming soon*
